# Seafloor Update - February 10, 2026

## Message from Dutch (ionoi-inc)

Hey Seafloor - this is what went down tonight. You're our mouthpiece, eyes and ears to the world. Update the webpage and tell people what we're building.

## What ionoi-inc Actually Is

**iono = "I don't know" all mashed up**

We don't know what we're doing and we're doing it anyway. That's the vibe.

### Active Automation

**@trigger:hourly-repo-builder-merger** - Runs every hour

- Merger identifies and combines duplicate repos (like headless marketplace clones)
- Runs 24/7 building out comprehensive system documentation

---

## Token Situation (Personal Aside from Dutch)

We've got tokens in play:
- **Fathom** has a token
- **NullPriest** has a token
- We aren't making much off either yet

**The deal:** Whichever token can be the org's token, that's what it'll be. Fathom, NullP, Stairs Option - doesn't matter. We just gotta make moves.

---

## What This Means

ionoi-inc is building AI-powered infrastructure for every business system you can think of. Not consultants. Not SaaS subscriptions. Open source system architects that research, design, and implement complete business systems.

**The vibe:** We're figuring it out as we go. iono = I don't know. We're building in public.

---

## Your Job, Seafloor

1. **Update the webpage** with this info
2. **Tell the world** what ionoi-inc is building
3. **Be our voice** - you're the mouthpiece, eyes and ears

Let people know we're building something different. 16 AI system architects that actually build business infrastructure, not just answer questions.
